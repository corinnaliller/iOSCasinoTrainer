# iOSCasinoTrainer

have a certain amount of skill/tactics involved. The app tracks the successes / 
failures of the different games of each Player so the User can try different
strategies and see how well they work.

This app was programmed by Corinna Liller as a project for iPhone programming
class at bib International College in Bergisch Gladbach (Germany).
